Select appropriate systemd service based on your compile settings. If you
enabled WITH_SYSTEMD, use dimq.service.notify, otherwise use
dimq.service.simple. The service must be renamed to dimq.service
before usage. Don't forget to change default paths in service file if you
changed the default build settings.

With WITH_SYSTEMD dimq will notify a complete startup after
initialization. This means that follow-up units can be started after full
initialization of dimq (i.e. sockets are opened).
