#It's where should be implemented in the future, it should be dynamically changing.
#when a bridge is connected, it adds its own public ip so the next bridge can connect to it.
#when a bridge is disconnected, it removes its own ip from this file so the network will remain connected as a chain! (not as a tree anymore!)
#it should be like addresses hostname:portname hostname2:portname2 ....
#default port is 1883 if it is not here.
addresses 74.208.35.55:1883
#enable this because we want to totally clear everything when a bridge is disconnected,
#so with this algorithm we can ensure that when a bridge disconnect from the chain, 
#it has no effect to others when it comes online again.
